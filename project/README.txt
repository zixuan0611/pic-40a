This website is a simple calendar for registered users to add events. All the events added by the user can be seen every time he or she logs in. There is also a hide button for every event, which can be used for every log in session. Theoretically, the user can see as many dates as he or she wants and add as many events as he or she wants.

Thank you for this great quarter.
